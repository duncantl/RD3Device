This package implements an R graphics device that generates D3
JavaScript code to render the R plots in a Web browser.  It allows us
to export R graphics to a Web browser using D3. It also allows us to
post-process the generated code and to add interactivity.

<p>


<p> In addition to rendering R graphics via D3, the package also
provides two functions to create D3 displays using D3's own graphical
layouts.

<p>
This is currently a rapidly created prototype and exploration
of some of the ideas.
This also explores how we can match graphical elements to
how they were created and so identify, e.g., data points,
tick marks on axes, text in legends, etc.
This allows us to post-process the elements to add interaction
and animation.


<p>
There are some similarities between this package and
gridSVG and SVGAnnotation.


<p>
The code is entirely written in R, leveraging the RGraphicsDevice
package to write a device with R functions.
This makes it quite easy to change how we generate the JavaScript
code and post-process it.
