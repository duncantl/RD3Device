Allow R programmer to post-process the code,
e.g. put names on the polygons in a map plot,
identify the points and add tooltips.
Can work with groups in D3.
Can detect these groups based on the common sys.calls()
for elements.
<br/>
Structure the code from the device so that we can post-process it.
Could do this generically, i.e. get the display list
and then map this to D3 afterwards.
