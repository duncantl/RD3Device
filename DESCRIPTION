Title: R Graphics device to create D3 content
Author: Duncan Temple Lang
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@r-project.org>
Description: This is an experiment to create a graphics
  device for R that creates D3 code for displaying
  the  R plot in JavaScript.
  As we go forward, we can programmatically annotate 
  the content of the plot to create interactive, dynamic
  plots with animation.   
  This is similar to gridSVG, SVGAnnotation, etc.
  It is not intended to allow R users to create arbitrary
  D3 code. It is solely focused on mapping existing R plotting
  commands using R's graphics system(s) to D3 code.
  Given the RGraphicsDevice package, this is very easy to write entirely
  within R. It takes longer to understand the D3 programming details than
  to implement the graphics device's methods.
